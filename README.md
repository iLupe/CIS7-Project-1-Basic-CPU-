// When starting on the programming(Encryption) for case-project 3, I evaluated other types of
// ciphers such as Caesar and Linear Shift for encryption for comparisons. During my evaluation,
// I found out that the Caesar cipher is similar to the Vigenere cipher in a way that it involves
// its 26 possible ciphers.
